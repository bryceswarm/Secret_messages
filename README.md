# Secret_messages

Choose at least three basic ciphers from the following list to implement encrypting and decrypting abilities.

Alberti cipher
Affine cipher
Atbash cipher
Polybius square cipher
Transposition cipher
ADFGVX cipher
Bifid cipher
Keyword cipher
Hill cipher

NOTE: The included sample Caesar Cipher does not count towards one of the three required implementations.

Provide a command line menu providing an option to either encrypt or decrypt a value and then a sub menu with a list of implemented ciphers.

Write a separate class, which inherits from cipher, and implements encrypt and decrypt functionality for each of your chosen ciphers.

Prompt the user for input to encrypt or decrypt and, if applicable, any additional input settings required to perform the cipher process.

The input value is correctly encrypted or decrypted using the chosen cipher and the output is displayed on the screen.

Remember to include informative docstrings in your functions and/or methods.

Make sure to follow the PEP 8 guidelines for coding style and write organized, easy to follow code. General code comments are great to add to your code too.
